# Information and Belief

## Abstract

The name of God changes each century, but the name of the "big organizing 
principle" also changes, even if no explicit name tangibly exists. This 
would be the basic premise of cybernetic semiotics or semiotic alchemy,
founding meta-analyses of the intentional sciences. In Baruch Spinoza's 
day, it was important to establish terms not only in the Latin (syntax, 
prole) but also the diction (semantics) of learned truth. How has this 
dance of foundationalism benefited us? From the depths of this question 
we shall handle the geometric instruments afforded to us by Spinoza's 
hyperrationalistic method and rigor in hopes to liberate yet another 
ghost in the machine of technology.
